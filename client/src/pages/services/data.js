      "I use CSS Flexbox and Grid to create responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. By leveraging these CSS modules, I optimize the website's structure to ensure content is displayed efficiently across devices. This approach allows for a fluid and flexible design that responds to the width of the browser, providing an optimal viewing experience whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. ",
      "For adaptive web design, I utilize CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics, such as its width, height, or orientation. This technique enables me to optimize the layout and appearance for specific devices, offering a customized experience that caters to various user environments. By fine-tuning the design for different breakpoints, I ensure that the website is accessible and user-friendly across all platforms.",
